                    <h2>Leonor Medeiros</h2>
                    <h4>Fashion Designer</h4>
                    <p>Hi, I'm Leonor, a passionate fashion designer with 5
                        years of experience in creating unique and innovative
                        designs that blend creativity, functionality, and
                        personal expression. Fashion has always been my way of
                        telling stories—whether through bold silhouettes,
                        intricate details, or unexpected textures.</p>
                    <p>After earning my degree in [Fashion Design], I have had
                        the opportunity to work with a range of clients and
                        brands, honing my skills in pattern making, garment
                        construction, and fabric selection. My journey has taken
                        me from [mention a notable experience, like working with
                        a fashion house or launching a collection] to developing
                        collections that reflect my personal design philosophy:
                        fashion should empower and inspire.</p>
                </article>
            </section>
            <div class="about_me">
                <p>I draw inspiration from [mention your influences—nature,
                    culture, art, etc.] and enjoy pushing boundaries to create
                    looks that are both modern and timeless. With a strong eye
                    for trends and a love for experimenting with colors and
                    shapes, I’m constantly evolving as a designer while staying
                    true to my core values of craftsmanship and
                    sustainability.</p>
                <p>Whether it's creating custom pieces for individual clients,
                    collaborating on new collections, or working with teams to
                    bring visions to life, I am always eager to take on exciting
                    new challenges. I'm proud to be at an intermediate stage in
                    my career, where my creativity, technical expertise, and
                    passion for fashion continue to grow.</p>
                <p>Thank you for stopping by my portfolio. I look forward to
                    connecting and exploring how we can create something
                    beautiful together.</p>
